Objects and its internal representation:

1. Objects are important data types in javascript. 

2. Objects are different than primitive datatypes 
   (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 

3. Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 

4. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties 
   and methods, respectively.

5. Every object has some property associated with some value.


Example:

var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Suzuki';
myCar.model = 'Altros';
myCar.year = 1978;
myCar.wheels = 2;

After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.

i.e.
>myCar.year
>Output: 1978

These values can be accessed using brackets notation also.

>myCar[year]
>Output: 1978
